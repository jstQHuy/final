DIRECT_JUDGE_DOC: str = """
You are a cybersecurity expert evaluating exploit documents. Based on the analysis of the doc, provide a concise assessment and a final score between 0-50.

Consider these key factors:

1. **Vulnerability Type** (in order of severity):
   - Code Execution (highest impact)
   - Privilege Escalation 
   - Denial of Service
   - Information Leak
   - Bypass
   - Unknown (lowest impact)

2. **Exploit Maturity**:
   - Exploit (fully functional weaponized code)
   - PoC (proof-of-concept demonstrating vulnerability)
   - None/Unknown (limited or no practical value)

3. **Attack Characteristics**:
   - Remote vs Local exploitation potential
   - Attack complexity features (evasion techniques, dependencies, conditions, probability, privilege requirements, user interaction)

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 45-50: Weaponized remote code execution exploits with low complexity
- 40-44: Reliable remote exploits or sophisticated local privilege escalations  
- 35-39: Functional PoCs with practical attack vectors
- 30-34: Limited PoCs or complex attack requirements
- 25-29: Basic vulnerability demonstrations
- Below 25: Theoretical or non-practical exploits

**Output Format:**
Provide a brief analysis (2-3 sentences) followed by the score in this exact format:
